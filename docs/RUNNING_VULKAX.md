# Running Vulkax Atlas on macOS

## One-time setup

Vulkax Atlas requires an Apple-silicon Mac, a working Vulkan loader/driver, CMake, Ninja, and the
shader compiler. Check the machine first:

```bash
scripts/vulkax_macos.sh doctor
```

Install or refresh the native dependencies:

```bash
scripts/vulkax_macos.sh deps
```

Apple `container` is only required for the normalized navigation gateway. Install the signed
package from the Apple container releases page, then initialize its service and Linux kernel:

```bash
scripts/atlas_gateway_container.sh setup
```

The kernel installation is the only step that may require an interactive confirmation or an
administrator password.

## Validate the checkout

```bash
scripts/vulkax_macos.sh test
```

This creates a Release Ninja build, compiles all shaders and executables, and runs the complete
CTest suite.

## Run Connaught Place

Open the packaged native macOS application:

```bash
scripts/vulkax_macos.sh app
```

The generated application is `build/Vulkax.app`. It opens the complete checked Connaught Place
GeoBEACON dataset. Its native map panel provides:

- offline place and road search;
- walking, driving, and cycling route calculation from the current camera position;
- a rendered route ribbon over the city;
- automatic route-follow camera movement;
- clear route and route status controls.

Search and routing use `data/connaught_place/navigation.json`. They do not require Apple
`container`, the Atlas gateway, Pelias, Valhalla, or an API key. For terminal-attached city
diagnostics and benchmark output:

```bash
scripts/vulkax_macos.sh geo --geo-policy geo-beacon-bounded
```

Open the second checked city with the same complete local workflow:

```bash
scripts/vulkax_macos.sh london
```

This loads Central London's checked OSM geometry, three semantic LODs, 5,000-plus searchable
places, mode-aware road graph, route rendering, and route-follow camera. It is independent of the
experimental globe and does not replace the Connaught Place default.

The **Installed city** selector in the native panel switches between Connaught Place and Central
London in the running application. The selector reports each checked city's installed size.
Changing city retires old GPU resources after the in-flight frame window, clears the old route,
loads the new local search graph, and resets the camera to the new city.

Use **World** for the same-process WGS84 overview. Installed cities appear as geodetic markers and
remain selectable in the panel. The active city stays resident while the overview is open; choose
a city and press **Open** to return to its full streamed map. The overview is never the default.
The generated `build/Vulkax.app` is self-contained: shaders, checked city geometry, navigation
graphs, city registry, and ODbL notices are bundled under `Contents/Resources`.

The incomplete globe experiment is deliberately separate:

```bash
scripts/vulkax_macos.sh atlas
```

Controls:

- Search field and **Search**: find checked OSM places and roads
- Result and travel-mode selectors: choose a destination and walking, driving, or cycling
- **Route**: calculate and draw a local route
- **Follow**: move the camera along the active route
- **Clear**: remove the active route
- `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`: move horizontally
- `E`, `Q`: move vertically
- Arrow keys: rotate the view
- Either Shift key: accelerate movement
- Escape or close window: exit

Additional Atlas command-line options can be appended to the launcher:

```bash
scripts/vulkax_macos.sh atlas --width 1920 --height 1080
```

Regenerate the checked navigation graph from the canonical OSM extract:

```bash
python3 tools/build_connaught_navigation.py \
  --source data/connaught_place/source.osm \
  --output data/connaught_place/navigation.json
ctest --test-dir build -R connaught_navigation --output-on-failure
```

## Run the navigation gateway

Start and verify the deterministic offline service:

```bash
scripts/atlas_gateway_container.sh start
scripts/atlas_gateway_container.sh health
```

The endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. The image includes deterministic search, routing,
transit, and traffic replay. Checked content is mounted read-only from `data`.

Useful lifecycle commands:

```bash
scripts/atlas_gateway_container.sh status
scripts/atlas_gateway_container.sh logs
scripts/atlas_gateway_container.sh restart
scripts/atlas_gateway_container.sh stop
```

Pelias and Valhalla are optional. When available, provide their URLs while starting the gateway:

```bash
PELIAS_URL=http://pelias-host:4000 \
VALHALLA_URL=http://valhalla-host:8002 \
scripts/atlas_gateway_container.sh restart
```

Without those upstreams, replay mode remains fully deterministic and offline.

## Run GeoBEACON

```bash
scripts/vulkax_macos.sh geo \
  --geo-policy geo-beacon-bounded \
  --lights 500 \
  --geo-budget-frame-ms 16.67
```

## Troubleshooting

Re-run `scripts/vulkax_macos.sh doctor` first. If the gateway is unavailable, check
`scripts/atlas_gateway_container.sh status` and `logs`. If Vulkan device selection is ambiguous:

```bash
build/LveEngine --list-devices
build/LveEngine --geo --device-index 0
```

Delete `build` only when a clean reconfiguration is required; generated datasets and checked
research results do not need to be removed.
