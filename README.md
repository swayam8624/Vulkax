# GeoBEACON Vulkan Research Renderer

GeoBEACON is a reproducible Vulkan urban digital-twin renderer built around a checked OpenStreetMap
extract of Connaught Place, New Delhi. It extends BEACON's adaptive clustered lighting with
semantic tile selection, asynchronous city streaming, memory and upload budgets, deterministic
camera routes, exact diffuse reference captures, and separate GPU-query, CPU-fallback, and
analytical measurement classes.

## Research claim

GeoBEACON evaluates whether joint semantic and view-aware allocation of geometry detail, streaming
bandwidth, resident memory, and diffuse-light accuracy provides more task-relevant utility per
millisecond than fixed LOD, distance-only LOD, semantic-only LOD, or lighting-only adaptation.
SSBO lighting, instancing, clustered lighting, bounded pruning, glTF, and 3D Tiles are supporting
infrastructure rather than novelty claims.

## Implemented policies

| CLI policy | Geometry allocation | Lighting |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fixed-lod1` | LOD1 for every selected tile | camera-space fixed GPU clusters |
| `distance-lod` | distance thresholds | camera-space fixed GPU clusters |
| `semantic-lod` | distance scaled by semantic importance | camera-space fixed GPU clusters |
| `geo-beacon-exact` | semantic budget controller | adaptive exact diffuse lists |
| `geo-beacon-bounded` | semantic budget controller | adaptive aggregate-bounded pruning |

The original BEACON CLI identifiers remain available: `baseline`, `ssbo`, `ssbo-diffuse`,
`instanced`, `cpu-clustered`, `fixed-cluster-cost-model`, `gpu-clustered`, `adaptive-exact`,
`adaptive-bounded`, and `beacon`.

The fixed GPU clustered path projects finite-radius lights into screen tiles and logarithmic
camera-space depth slices. Assignment is implemented as clear, light-centric count, hierarchical
exclusive scan, offset propagation, and scatter compute stages. Overflow is flagged and rendered
through an exact all-light fallback.

## Dataset

The canonical study area is:

```text
Connaught Place, New Delhi
south 28.6270, west 77.2070, north 28.6365, east 77.2245
```

`data/connaught_place/source.osm` is the authoritative checked source. The deterministic
preprocessor emits 151 spatial tiles, three GLB representations per tile, a 3D Tiles 1.1
`tileset.json`, runtime metadata, checksums, and a validation report. Runtime rendering permanently
shows `© OpenStreetMap contributors`.

Regenerate the committed tile database:

```bash
python3 tools/build_geobeacon_tiles.py \
  --source data/connaught_place/source.osm \
  --output data/connaught_place/generated
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Network acquisition is explicit and never runs during build or startup:

```bash
python3 tools/fetch_osm_extract.py --output data/connaught_place/source.osm
```

## Build and test

macOS prerequisites include CMake, GLFW, GLM, nlohmann-json, a Vulkan loader, and
`glslangValidator`.

```bash
brew install cmake glfw glm nlohmann-json vulkan-loader glslang
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
cmake --build build -j 8
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

List devices and select one deterministically:

```bash
build/LveEngine --list-devices
build/LveEngine --geo --device-index 0
build/LveEngine --geo --device-name "Apple M2 Pro"
build/LveEngine --geo --device-uuid 0000106b-1a05-0208-0000-000000000000
```

## Run

Interactive city rendering:

```bash
build/LveEngine --geo --geo-policy geo-beacon-bounded \
  --lights 500 --geo-budget-frame-ms 16.67 \
  --geo-budget-memory-mib 512 --geo-budget-upload-mibps 100
```

Deterministic measured run:

```bash
build/LveEngine --geo --geo-policy geo-beacon-bounded \
  --geo-camera-path landmark-approach --geo-cache-mode cold \
  --lights 500 --width 1920 --height 1080 \
  --warmup-frames 600 --frames 1800 --capture-reference true \
  --output docs/results/my_run
```

Camera routes are `outer-orbit`, `street-drive`, `intersection-dwell`, `landmark-approach`, and
`rapid-teleport`. Each measured run writes frame-level CSV, a reproducibility manifest, exact and
test PPM captures when enabled, and a summary. Terminal runs include a progress bar unless
`--quiet` is supplied.

## Experiments

The full resumable matrix encodes five policies, five routes, 100/500/2,000 lights, two frame
budgets, three memory budgets, three upload limits, three resolutions, cold/warm caches, two local
ICDs, and five trials:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_geobeacon_matrix.py \
  --binary build/LveEngine \
  --output docs/results/geobeacon_full \
  --profile full
python3 scripts/generate_beacon_figures.py \
  docs/results/geobeacon_full \
  docs/results/geobeacon_full/figures
```

`smoke` and `core` profiles use the same runner for validation and intermediate studies.

## Checked results

`docs/results/geobeacon_smoke` contains 20 completed dual-driver pilot cases: all five policies,
outer-orbit and rapid-teleport, 100 lights, a 256 MiB memory budget, a 25 MiB/s upload limit, 30
warm-up frames, and 60 measured frames. This is an execution and instrumentation validation set,
not the full repeated-trial claim.

| Driver / timing class | Policy | CPU p50 ms | CPU p95 ms | GPU cluster + light p50 ms |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| MoltenVK / Vulkan timestamps | fixed LOD1 | 7.221 | 8.709 | 0.2602 |
| MoltenVK / Vulkan timestamps | GeoBEACON exact | 8.331 | 12.156 | 0.1875 |
| MoltenVK / Vulkan timestamps | GeoBEACON bounded | 8.270 | 12.364 | 0.1308 |
| KosmicKrisp / Vulkan CPU fallback | fixed LOD1 | 8.353 | 12.060 | unavailable |
| KosmicKrisp / Vulkan CPU fallback | GeoBEACON exact | 13.147 | 17.891 | unavailable |
| KosmicKrisp / Vulkan CPU fallback | GeoBEACON bounded | 12.914 | 18.185 | unavailable |

MoltenVK reports timestamp-query support on this Apple M2 Pro. KosmicKrisp does not, so its rows
are explicitly classified as Vulkan CPU measurements. Exact and bounded runs store rendered MSE,
PSNR, SSIM, maximum pixel error, and temporal MSE variation separately from conservative modeled
bounds.

## Research scope

The formal error account covers opaque, unshadowed diffuse finite-radius point lighting. Strict
specular bounds, shadows, transparency, neural rendering, imagery, Gaussian splats, sensor
simulation, ROS, CARLA, and live network streaming are outside the evaluated claim.
